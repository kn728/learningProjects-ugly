This project has reached a stage where I believe it is of high enough quality to continue progress on the main portfolio. 
The main lesson I learned from this project are:
- understanding nodejs, react-redux, and mongo db.

I have grown passionate about this project and plan to have it completed in the myPortfolio repository.
